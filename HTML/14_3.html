				<p><font color="purple"> <font face=algerian > No matter how many good TV series or films that appear these days, one thing’s for sure: books will never go out of style 
				and there will always be bookworms around us. You don’t have to run a book club or to be a publisher in order to be interested
				 in creating a useful book catalog design. You simply have to be an avid reader that wishes to keep track of the books that have
				 just arrived in stores or the books that have been on your reading list for a while, but never managed to read due to lack of 
				organization. Sounds interesting and fascinating, right? </font></font> </p>
